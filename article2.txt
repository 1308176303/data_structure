Climate change refers to long-term changes in temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions on Earth. It is largely driven by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, causing the planet to warm and leading to a phenomenon known as global warming.

The impacts of climate change are widespread and severe. Rising global temperatures are causing polar ice caps to melt, leading to rising sea levels that threaten coastal communities. Extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, droughts, and floods, are becoming more frequent and intense. These changes are not only damaging ecosystems but are also having profound effects on agriculture, water supply, and human health.

One of the most concerning aspects of climate change is its effect on biodiversity. Many species are unable to adapt to the changing conditions and are facing extinction. The loss of biodiversity can have cascading effects on ecosystems, affecting everything from food chains to pollination.

To address climate change, world leaders have called for global cooperation to reduce carbon emissions and invest in renewable energy sources. The Paris Agreement, signed in 2015, aims to limit global temperature rise to below 2Â°C above pre-industrial levels. However, much work remains to be done to mitigate the effects of climate change and protect the planet for future generations.
